# CSS-flexBox Assignment: 

1. First: Use flexbox to style a typical header navbar.

2. Use position to change the placing of the h3 element (sale)

3. Use flexbox and media query (included in the CSS document
already) in order to get a layout that has a row direction when the
screen is 900px wide or wider and column direction when the
screen is narrower.
